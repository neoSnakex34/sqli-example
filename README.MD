## WHAT IS THIS REPO?
This repo is intended as a demo for showing sql vulnerabilities when writing bad code. The program in this repo simulates a poorly written webapp that can be vulnerable to sql injection attacks
no malicious queries would be provided into the repo directly. Demonstration would be supplied into my final paper only.

## PLEASE NOTE!
This is intended for educational purposes only, i do not encourage nor i condone any illegal action.  

## ALSO NOTICE THAT 
The structure of the project is slightly based on Enrico Bassetti's [fantastic coffee (decaffeinated)](https://github.com/sapienzaapps/fantastic-coffee-decaffeinated) template. It is not a 1:1 rip off as i built it manually, not forking nor cloning, but still is heavily inspired on that template. 


## TODOS 
- [x] add docker support 
- [x] list dangerouse code and explain why is bad
